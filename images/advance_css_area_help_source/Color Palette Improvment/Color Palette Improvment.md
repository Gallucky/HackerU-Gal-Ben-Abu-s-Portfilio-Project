### Me:
Currently this is my color pallete:
```css
--color-palette-dominant: #36454f;
--color-palette-complementary: #008080; 
--color-palette-accent: #ffa500;
```
It is it good? What change of colors will make it look better?
maybe to add more complementary / dominant / accent colors to the pallete (I am using the 60 / 30 / 10 rule...)

### ChatGPT:
Your current color palette is a solid foundation, but here are some suggestions to enhance it while adhering to the 60/30/10 rule:

### Suggested Color Palette

1. **Dominant Color (#36454f)**: Keep this as your primary background or main color.
  
2. **Complementary Color (#008080)**: This works well as a secondary color. 

3. **Accent Color (#ffa500)**: Great choice for highlights or call-to-action elements.

### Additional Colors

- **Light Neutral (e.g., #f0f0f0)**: A very light gray or off-white can serve as a background or to balance the darker colors.
  
- **Dark Neutral (e.g., #2c3e50)**: A darker gray can complement your dominant color and provide depth.
  
- **Additional Accent Color (e.g., #e74c3c)**: A softer or contrasting accent (like a warm red) can add vibrancy and draw attention.
